# 🌿 Flow Garden — The NFT That Grows Automatically

Flow Garden is a playful on-chain experience where your NFT plant grows by itself — completely powered by Flow’s new Actions and Scheduled Transactions.

When you mint a Seed, it starts as a tiny sprout 🌱.
Every 24 hours, a scheduled on-chain transaction automatically triggers an Action that helps your plant grow — from Seed → Sprout → Bloom.
After a few growth cycles, your NFT fully blossoms 🌸 and becomes a permanent digital flower in your wallet.

>No backend servers. No cron jobs. Everything happens natively on Flow.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Mint your Seed — claim a small seed NFT directly on Flow.
2. Schedule Growth — set the automatic growth cycle (once every 24h).
3. Watch it Grow — each day, the on-chain Action updates your NFT’s stage and metadata.
4. Collect your Bloom — after 3 cycles, your plant becomes a fully bloomed NFT.
